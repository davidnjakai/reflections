What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A hidden folder is created that stores metadata concerning the main folder (repository) and git information
Initialization ensures git knows the current folder is a repository and thus one can track changes made to the files
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
You are able to ensure that all the commits being done involve only the files you're concerned with
You are also able to see the changes between files in the working dir and S.area and between S.area and the most recent commit
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches help a developer make experimental changes incrementally by using a branch different from the main (master) branch thus not affecting the 
development or current functionality of the main one.
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The tree structure helps illustrate and conceptualize how branches work
It helps determine what set of commits are being tracked by git log from the HEAD
