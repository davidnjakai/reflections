When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When one is not certain about access to the local machine in future, they may want to use a remote repository as a backup.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because changes by collaborators may be pulled without the knowledge of one editing on a local machine.
This may bring about confusion.
