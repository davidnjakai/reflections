When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When one is not certain about access to the local machine in future, they may want to use a remote repository as a backup.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
This is because changes by collaborators may be pulled without the knowledge of one editing on a local machine.
This may bring about confusion.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones of repositories stored under one's github username and retrieved from a different repositry.
Clones are copies of repositories e.g. a clone of a github repository on the local machine or a clone of a local repository on the local machine.
Branches are versions under the same repository having different labels to mark the different branch heads.
